	  <h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <p>Time complexity refers to how the runtime of an algorithm grows 
		as the size of the input increases. It measures the efficiency of 
		an algorithm in terms of execution time. Efficient algorithms strive 
		to minimize the time complexity to handle larger datasets quickly.</p>

    <p>Space Complexity, on the other hand, measures the amount of memory an 
		algorithm consumes relative to the size of the input. It considers 
		auxiliary space used in addition to the input data. 
		For example, <b>Space Complexity</b> 
		can be expressed as O(n), where 'n' is the size of the input data.</p>
