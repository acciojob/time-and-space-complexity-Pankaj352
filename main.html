	  <h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <p>Time complexity is a measure of how the runtime of an algorithm increases as the size of the input grows. It helps evaluate the efficiency of algorithms by determining the amount of time they take to complete tasks. Designing efficient algorithms with optimal time complexity is crucial for handling large datasets effectively.</p>

    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses, including the input data and any additional space required during execution. It helps assess how efficiently an algorithm utilizes memory resources. For example, Space Complexity can often be represented as O(n), where 'n' denotes the size of the input.</p>
