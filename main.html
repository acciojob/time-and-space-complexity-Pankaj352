	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>The time complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input.</p>
	<p>The space complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of space taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input. For example, <b>Space Complexity</b> can be expressed as O(n), where 'n' is the size of the input data.</p>
